# Assets Directory

This directory contains files that are used in the OUTPUT Claude produces, not loaded into Claude's context.

## What Goes Here

**Templates**
- Document templates (.docx, .pptx, .pdf)
- Code boilerplate and project starters
- Configuration file templates

**Visual Assets**
- Images (.png, .jpg, .svg)
- Logos and icons
- Diagrams and illustrations

**Fonts**
- TrueType fonts (.ttf)
- OpenType fonts (.otf)
- Web fonts (.woff, .woff2)

**Data Files**
- Sample datasets (.csv, .json)
- Configuration examples (.yaml, .xml)
- Test data

## Usage Pattern

Assets are typically:
1. Copied to the working directory
2. Modified/customized for the specific task
3. Included in the final output

Example:
```bash
# Copy template to working area
cp assets/template.txt my_document.txt

# Customize as needed
sed -i 's/\[Project Title\]/My Actual Project/g' my_document.txt

# Use in output
cat my_document.txt
```

## Best Practices

- Keep files at reasonable sizes
- Use common, widely-supported formats
- Include clear documentation in SKILL.md about how to use each asset
- Organize by type if you have many assets
- Only include assets that are frequently needed

## Not for Context

Unlike references/, files here are NOT meant to be read into Claude's context window. They are resources that get used in the work Claude produces.
